Welcome to WeatherGame, a fantasy sports-style game based on real-world weather events!

Every week, you will face off with another team in a head to head matchup. The categories change every week. They might reward heat, accurate forecasts, straying from historical averages -- each week something new!

To get started, you will make a team by selecting 3 cities. The top 100 US cities are available, as well as a hundred or so cities from around the world. Watch out for Southern Hemisphere or equatorial cities, they could be a big help or huge weakness... 

Once you make a team, you can either create a league or join an existing one.

Be sure to log on each week so you can set Boosts for the following week. Boosts allow you to add or remove points from a category depending on your team's strengths.
